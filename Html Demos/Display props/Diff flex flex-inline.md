\## When to use which one?

Use display: flex when:



**You are building layout sections**



* Navbar / header row



* Card grids (row of cards)



* Form rows



* Footer columns



You want the container to occupy full width and behave like a block.



**Use display: inline-flex when:**



You want a flex group inside a line of text



* Inline chips/tags



* Small button group inside a sentence



* Badge + icon + text inline



You want the container to wrap with text and not force a new line.
