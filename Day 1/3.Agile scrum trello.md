# Agile + Scrum End-to-End Example Using Trello (E-Commerce Application)

> **Scenario:** We are building an **E-commerce application** using Agile + Scrum, and managing everything in **Trello**.  
> We’ll define modules, epics, user stories, tasks, team roles, sprints, story points, velocity, metrics, and ceremonies – all as if this is a real project.

---

## 1. Project & Team Setup

### 1.1 Project Vision

> **Build an E-commerce web + mobile app** where customers can browse products, add them to a cart, pay securely, and track their orders.

### 1.2 Team & Roles (With Example Names)

- **Product Owner (PO) / Product Manager**
  - **Name:** Ananya (PO)  
  - Owns the product vision, requirements, and **Product Backlog**.  
  - Decides the priority of features.

- **Scrum Master**
  - **Name:** Rohit (SM)  
  - Facilitates Scrum events, removes blockers, coaches team.

- **Tech Lead**
  - **Name:** Karthik (TL)  
  - Responsible for architecture, code reviews, technical decisions.

- **Developers**
  - **Priya (Dev)** – Frontend (React)  
  - **Amit (Dev)** – Backend (APIs, Database)  
  - **Farhan (Dev)** – Full Stack

- **Tester / QA Engineer**
  - **Meera (QA)** – Manual + automation testing.

- **UI/UX Designer**
  - **Sneha (UI/UX)** – Wireframes, mockups, design system.

- **DevOps Engineer (Optional but Useful)**
  - **Vikram (DevOps)** – CI/CD, environments, deployments.

This is a realistic Scrum team for our E-commerce project.

---

## 2. Define E-Commerce Modules (High-Level Requirements)

We assume our E-commerce app needs the following **functional modules**:

1. **User & Authentication**
   - User registration, login, logout, forgot password, profile management.

2. **Product Catalog**
   - Category management, product listing pages, product details.

3. **Search & Filter**
   - Search by product name, filters by price, brand, rating, etc.

4. **Shopping Cart**
   - Add to cart, remove from cart, update quantity.

5. **Checkout & Payment**
   - Address & shipping, payment gateway integration, order confirmation.

6. **Orders & Tracking**
   - View past orders, order details, order status (Processing, Shipped, Delivered).

7. **Admin Panel**
   - Add/edit/delete products, manage stock, manage orders.

8. **Reviews & Ratings**
   - Rate products, leave reviews, show average rating.

Each module can become one or more **Epics** in Agile.

---

## 3. Design Epics

An **Epic** is a **large feature** that can be broken down into multiple **user stories**.

You can represent **Epics** in Trello in two ways:

- Create a **list named `Epics`** and add one card per epic, or  
- Use **labels** like `EPIC: Product Catalog`, `EPIC: Cart`, etc. on user story cards.

### 3.1 Example Epics for E-Commerce

1. **EPIC: Product Catalog**
2. **EPIC: Shopping Cart**
3. **EPIC: Checkout & Payment**
4. **EPIC: Orders & Tracking**
5. **EPIC: Admin – Product Management**
6. **EPIC: User Authentication**

We will focus mainly on **EPIC: Product Catalog** as an end-to-end example.

---

## 4. Set Up Trello Board

Create a Trello board called:

> **E-Commerce – Agile Scrum Board**

### 4.1 Create Lists

Create the following lists in the board:

1. `Product Backlog`
2. `Sprint Backlog`
3. `In Progress`
4. `Code Review`
5. `Testing`
6. `Done`
7. (Optional) `Epics`, `To Discuss`, `Blocked`, `Reports`

### 4.2 Create Labels

Define labels in Trello, for example:

- `EPIC: Product Catalog`
- `EPIC: Cart`
- `EPIC: Checkout`
- `EPIC: Orders`
- `Bug`
- `Tech Debt`
- Priorities: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`

### 4.3 Custom Fields (If Available)

If using Trello Custom Fields Power-Up or a similar feature, add:

- **Story Points** (numeric)
- **Sprint #** (text)
- **Epic** (dropdown)

This makes Agile data visible directly on cards.

---

## 5. Epic → User Stories → Tasks

We’ll go deeper into **EPIC: Product Catalog**.

### 5.1 EPIC: Product Catalog (Trello Card)

In `Epics` list:

**Card Title:** `EPIC: Product Catalog`  
**Label:** `EPIC: Product Catalog`

**Description (Example):**

> Enable customers to browse products by category, view product details with images, prices, description, availability, and basic search functionality.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] US-101: View product listing by category  
- [ ] US-102: View product details page  
- [ ] US-103: Show stock availability & variants  
- [ ] US-104: Basic product search  

(Each of these will be **separate user story cards** in `Product Backlog`.)

---

## 6. Sample User Stories (Product Catalog)

Each user story is a separate card in `Product Backlog`.

### 6.1 User Story 1 – Product Listing by Category

**Card Title:**  
`US-101: Browse products by category (5 pts)`

**List:** `Product Backlog`  
**Labels:** `EPIC: Product Catalog`, `High`  
**Custom Field – Story Points:** `5`  

**Description (Story):**

> As a **customer**,  
> I want to **see a list of products by category**,  
> so that **I can quickly find items I’m interested in**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Customer can select a category (e.g., Mobiles, Laptops, Fashion).
- System shows a grid/list of products with:
  - Thumbnail image  
  - Product name  
  - Price  
  - Short description  
- Supports pagination or lazy loading for more than 20 products.
- Clicking on a product opens the **Product Detail** page.

---

### 6.2 User Story 2 – Product Detail Page

**Card Title:**  
`US-102: View product details (3 pts)`

**Labels:** `EPIC: Product Catalog`, `Medium`  
**Story Points:** `3`

**Description:**

> As a **customer**,  
> I want to **see detailed information about a product**,  
> so that **I can decide whether to buy it**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

---

### 6.3 User Story 3 – Basic Product Search

**Card Title:**  
`US-104: Search products by name (5 pts)`

**Labels:** `EPIC: Product Catalog`, `High`  
**Story Points:** `5`

**Description:**

> As a **customer**,  
> I want to **search products by name or keyword**,  
> so that **I can quickly find the product I need**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Search bar is visible in the header.
- Typing a keyword and pressing enter shows products matching the keyword.
- Partial match is supported (e.g., “iph” should show “iPhone 14 Pro”).
- If no products found, show a friendly “No results” message.

---

## 7. Breaking Stories into Tasks (Trello Checklists)

For each user story, we create **tasks** inside the card as a checklist, and/or separate sub-cards.

### 7.1 Example – Tasks for US-101: Browse Products by Category

**Card:** `US-101: Browse products by category (5 pts)`

**Checklist – Tasks:**

1. **UI/UX Design – Category & Listing Page**  
   *Assigned to:* Sneha (UI/UX)  
   - Design category selection & product grid layout.

2. **Frontend – Category Filter UI (React)**  
   *Assigned to:* Priya (Dev)  
   - Implement category selection UI and product card component.

3. **Backend – API to Fetch Products by Category**  
   *Assigned to:* Amit (Dev)  
   - Create `/api/products?category=<id>` endpoint.

4. **Database – Product & Category Schema**  
   *Assigned to:* Amit (Dev)  
   - Define `Products` and `Categories` tables and seed sample data.

5. **Integration – Connect Frontend with API**

## 8. Sprint Planning with Story Points (Step-by-Step)

Assumptions:

- **Sprint length:** 2 weeks.  
- **Initial velocity:** Team expects ~20 story points per sprint (guess).  
- **Sprint name:** `Sprint 1 – Product Catalog MVP`.

### 8.1 Step 1: PO Prioritizes Product Backlog

Ananya (PO) orders cards in `Product Backlog`:

1. `US-101: Browse products by category (5)`  
2. `US-102: View product details (3)`  
3. `US-104: Search products by name (5)`  
4. `US-201: Add to Cart (8)` (from Cart epic)  
5. `US-301: Basic Checkout (8)` (from Checkout epic)

### 8.2 Step 2: Story Point Estimation (Planning Poker)

During backlog refinement or sprint planning:

- Team discusses each story.  
- Everyone silently picks story point values (1, 2, 3, 5, 8…).  
- They reveal simultaneously and discuss differences.  
- Final consensus points are stored in Trello **Story Points** field.

(We already assumed the points: 5, 3, 5, 8, 8.)

### 8.3 Step 3: Select Stories for Sprint

Team targets ~20 points.

Move selected stories from `Product Backlog` → `Sprint Backlog`:

- `US-101` → 5 pts  
- `US-102` → 3 pts  
- `US-104` → 5 pts  
- `US-201` → 8 pts  

Total = **21 points** (acceptable as an initial experiment).

Add a **Sprint # field = 1** and/or label `Sprint 1` on each selected card.

### 8.4 Step 4: Confirm Tasks & Assign Members

Inside each story card, team:

- Reviews and completes the **tasks checklist**.  
- Assigns each task to a **specific member**.  
- Sets due dates within the sprint timeframe.

**Example – US-101 assignment:**

- UI/UX task → Sneha  
- Frontend task → Priya  
- Backend & DB tasks → Amit  
- Integration task → Farhan  
- Testing task → Meera  
- Code review → Karthik  
- Final acceptance → Ananya  

This is your **end-to-end planning** for Sprint 1.

## 9. Sprint Execution in Trello

### 9.1 Card Workflow

As the sprint starts:

Cards move left → right across lists:

`Sprint Backlog` → `In Progress` → `Code Review` → `Testing` → `Done`

**Example Flow:**

1. Priya starts React UI for product listing:  
   - Move `US-101` from `Sprint Backlog` → `In Progress`.
2. When dev work is ready for review:  
   - Move `US-101` → `Code Review`.
3. Karthik reviews and merges PR:  
   - Move `US-101` → `Testing`.
4. Meera tests and logs bugs (if any):  
   - If all good, move `US-101` → `Done`.

### 9.2 Daily Scrum (Stand-Up) Using Trello

Every day (15 minutes), the team meets (usually via call) and each member answers:

1. What did I do yesterday?  
2. What will I do today?  
3. Any blockers?

Trello helps here:

- Filter cards **assigned to me** in `Sprint Backlog` / `In Progress` / `Testing`.  
- Use comments in cards for status updates or blocking issues.  
- Rohit (Scrum Master) looks for blocked cards and helps remove impediments.

---

## 10. Velocity, Agile Metrics & Reporting

### 10.1 Sprint Velocity

At the end of **Sprint 1**, we count points of **stories that reached `Done`**:

- `US-101` (5 points) – Done  
- `US-102` (3 points) – Done  
- `US-104` (5 points) – In Testing (not Done)  
- `US-201` (8 points) – In Progress (not Done)

**Velocity for Sprint 1 = 5 + 3 = 8 points**

In Trello, create a card in `Reports` list:

> **Card Title:** `Sprint 1 – Summary & Velocity`  
> **Description:**  
> - Committed: 21 points  
> - Completed: 8 points  
> - Carryover: 13 points (US-104, US-201)  
> - Reasons: underestimation, environment setup delays.

Over multiple sprints, we might get:

- Sprint 1: 8 pts  
- Sprint 2: 14 pts  
- Sprint 3: 18 pts  

Average velocity ≈ **13–18 points per sprint**, which we use for planning.

### 10.2 Agile Metrics to Track

You can manage metrics with Trello + a spreadsheet:

- **Velocity** – points completed per sprint.  
- **Carryover stories** – stories not finished in a sprint.  
- **Cycle time** – time from `In Progress` to `Done`.  
- **Defects** – bugs found in testing vs production.  
- **WIP (Work In Progress)** – number of stories currently `In Progress`.

Create a `Metrics` or `Reports` list and keep summary cards per sprint with a link to a Google Sheet/Excel file.

---

## 11. Sprint Review & Sprint Retrospective

### 11.1 Sprint Review (Demo)

At the end of Sprint 1:

- The team demonstrates working features from **staging**:
  - Product listing by category (US-101).  
  - Product detail page (US-102).

Stakeholders give feedback:

- “Can we show rating stars on listing page?”  
- “Add a quick-view option.”

Each new requirement becomes a new story card in `Product Backlog`.

### 11.2 Sprint Retrospective (Improve the Process)

Create a Trello card:

> **Title:** `Retro – Sprint 1`

Use a simple format:

**What Went Well:**

- Design & frontend collaboration was smooth.  
- Trello board gave good visibility.

**What Didn’t Go Well:**

- We overcommitted (21 pts, completed 8).  
- Dev environment issues slowed backend.

**Action Items:**

- For Sprint 2, commit only **15 points** until velocity stabilizes.  
- Vikram (DevOps) to ensure dev/staging is ready before sprint.  
- Start backlog refinement earlier for complex features.

These action items are reviewed at the start of the next retro to ensure improvement.

## 12. How Agile + Scrum + Trello Simplify E-Commerce Delivery

### Without Agile / Trello

- Requirements scattered in emails and Word docs.  
- Team doesn’t know what to build first.  
- No transparency; managers constantly ask for updates.  
- At UAT, users say “This is not what we wanted.”

### With Agile + Scrum + Trello

- **Epics** → big chunks (Product Catalog, Cart, Checkout...).  
- **User Stories** → small, user-focused pieces of value.  
- **Tasks** → concrete tech work inside stories.  
- **Trello Board** → live view of status from `Backlog` to `Done`.  
- **Sprints, Story Points, Velocity** → realistic planning & forecasting.  
- **Sprint Review** → continuous product feedback.  
- **Sprint Retrospective** → continuous process improvement.
